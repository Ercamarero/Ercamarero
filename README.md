<h2>Hi, I'm Adrian Garrido!</h2>
<p><em> Student of Software Engineering at <href="https://www.um.es">University of Murcia </a></p>
<p> I am almost in my last year of my career, I am specializing in computer engineering, so I mainly work more in low level languages such as C, C++.
Apart from that I also worked with my classmates on a more front-end oriented project, which is in the repository linked to my account called Spotify-electron. </p>
